title: Mirroring packages
---

Dirigent can mirror packages from other registries allowing it to serve as a proxy for packagist.org, a Satis
installation or other third-party registries. You can manually add packages from an external registry or enable dynamic
mirroring so new packages automatically get added to the registry when a developer adds a package to their project
(through `composer update`).

When developers use Composer to install new packages that aren't in the registry yet, it checks for external registries
having automatic mirroring enabled and adds the package from the first registry that returns it. To change the order
of registries, move the registries up and down in the **Registries** overview.

## Add external registry
To add an external registry, go to **Registries** in the sidebar and click **Add Registry**.

### Package mirroring
When adding an external registry, you have the following options regarding package mirroring:

**Package mirroring disabled**<br>
Package mirroring is disabled for this external registry so new packages can't be added. Existing packages already
being mirrored will remain in the registry.

**Only mirror specified packages**<br>
Packages have to be manually added by an administrator from the registry. When developers request a new package the
registry will not request the package from this external registry.

**Automatically mirror packages on request**<br>
Packages can be added manually or will be created automatically when requested by a developer installing packages
(through `composer update`).
