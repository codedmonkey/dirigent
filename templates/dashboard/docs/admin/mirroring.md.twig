title: Mirroring packages
---

Dirigent can mirror packages from other registries allowing it to serve as a proxy for packagist.org, a Satis
installation or other third-party registries. You can manually add packages from an external registry or enable dynamic
mirroring so new packages automatically get added to the registry when a developer adds a package to their project
(through `composer update`).

When developers use Composer to install new packages that aren't in the registry yet, it checks for external registries
having automatic mirroring enabled and adds the package from the first registry that returns it. To change the order
of registries, move the registries up and down in the **Registries** overview.

## Add external registry
To add an external registry, go to **Registries** in the sidebar and click **Add Registry**.

### Package mirroring
The package mirroring option allows control over when a package from the mirror registry is added to the current
registry.

**Package mirroring disabled**<br>
Package mirroring is disabled for this external registry so new packages can't be added. Existing packages already
being mirrored will remain in the registry.

**Only mirror specified packages**<br>
Packages have to be manually added by an administrator from the registry. When developers request a new package the
registry will not request the package from this external registry.

**Automatically mirror packages on request**<br>
Packages can be added manually or will be created automatically when requested by a developer installing packages
(through `composer update`).

## Add mirrored packages
To add a package from an external registry, go to **Packages** in the sidebar and click **Add Package** >
**Mirror from registry**.

### Fetch strategy
It's possible to change how Dirigent fetches a mirrored package by changing the fetch strategy of the package. The
default fetch strategy can be changed by the system administrator.

**Fetch from registry** (default)<br>
Fetch package metadata directly from the mirror registry. Only metadata from the registry is available.

**Fetch from VCS**<br>
Fetch package from VCS if possible. Metadata is compiled from the source code, including distributions and README data.
