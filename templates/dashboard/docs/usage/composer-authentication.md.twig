title: Authenticate with Composer
---

Authenticating for this registry in your Composer installation is easy and can be achieved for all projects on your
system by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
 composer config --global --auth http-basic.{{ app.request.getHost() }} {{ app.user.username }} <access-token>
```

To learn more about how Composer handles authentication, please read the [Composer documentation][composer-doc-auth].
