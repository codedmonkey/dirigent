# Runs tools to validate dependencies. This workflow is triggered for new
# commits and every night for the default branch. If any of the jobs fail for
# new commits they're not allowed to be merged into the default branch. If it
# starts failing because of vulnerabilities, they must be fixed before new
# features are merged and a security release must be made.
